Configure an Ethernet interface as a VLAN trunk
---------------------------------------------------

Suppose that a host requires access to two VLANs, both carried by a trunk connected to physical interface eth0. The assigned IP addresses for the host are 192.168.2.1/24 on VLAN 2 and 192.168.3.1/24 on VLAN 3.

[+] First install the vlan package if it is not already present:

apt-get install vlan

[+] Configuring interfaces

vconfig add eth0 <VLAN ID>
ifconfig eth0.<VLAN ID> <IP Address>/24 up
ifconfig eth0.<VLAN ID>

Note: If any issues run, ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 up
